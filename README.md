# Face recognition UI
Simple UI for face_recognition packege. Just some practice. More features maybe later.

## Instalation and running
Simply clone repo and run *main.py*
```
$ git clone https://github.com/random-accnt/face_recognition_ui.git
$ python main.py
```

## Usage
One folder with known faces and image with unknown face is needed. Multiple faces in single picture can be processed but for now only the first one is used.
